# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns. Each branch corresponds to a different design pattern.

## List of Branches and Design Patterns

1. **[part1-factory-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part1-factory-pattern)**
    - This branch includes an implementation of the Factory Pattern.
    - The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating instances of a class, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

2. **[part2-builder-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part2-builder-pattern)**
    - This branch demonstrates the Builder Pattern.
    - The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

3. **[part3-factory-method-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part3-factory-method-pattern)**
    - This branch showcases the Factory Method Pattern.
    - The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

4. **[part4-prototype-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part4-prototype-pattern)**
    - This branch illustrates the Prototype Pattern.
    - The Prototype Pattern allows for creating new objects by copying an existing object, providing a more efficient way to create instances.

5. **[part5-decorator-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part5-decorator-pattern)**
    - This branch implements the Decorator Pattern.
    - The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

6. **[part6-singleton-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part6-singleton-pattern)**
    - This branch demonstrates the Singleton Pattern.
    - The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

7. **[part7-adapter-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part7-adapter-pattern)**
    - This branch includes an implementation of the Adapter Pattern.
    - The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together, acting as a bridge between them.

8. **[part8-bridge-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part8-bridge-pattern)**
    - This branch showcases the Bridge Pattern.
    - The Bridge Pattern separates abstraction from implementation, allowing them to vary independently.

9. **[part9-facade-pattern](https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns/tree/part9-facade-pattern)**
    - This branch illustrates the Facade Pattern.
    - The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/muminvarici/design-patterns.git
    ```

2. Checkout the branch corresponding to the design pattern you want to explore:

    ```bash
    git checkout branch-name
    ```

3. Explore the code and learn how each design pattern is implemented.
